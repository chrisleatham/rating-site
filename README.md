Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
  Yes, I received help from Alex Bell-Towne and Arvin as well Mike Freeman. 
Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
  No, I did not do any of the extra credit for this challenge.
Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
  If I had to guess, I would say that it took about 16 hours in total to complete for me. I was constantly in the TE Lab from maybe 5 pm to 1 am about 4 days this week.
Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
  Maybe have less requirements out of it. I know a very large amount of students really struggled to get it done. The TE Lab was always packed with people who had no idea what they were doing and were all working on this assignment.
